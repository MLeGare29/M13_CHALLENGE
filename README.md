# VENTURE FUNDING RISK MANAGEMENT

## OVERVIEW

The backbone of every economy is the private sector and the businesses, both big and small that keeps the economy running. But no business can succeed alone, and that's where Alphabet Soup comes in. As a venture capital firm, Alphabet Soup helps to faciliate this success. However, no venture is without considerable risk, that is part of the landscape. In an effort to effectively mitigate this risk, the application of deep learning will become integral in predicting which of the thousands of applicants that submit requests for funding will be successful if funded. To answer this call, I have used the power of data analytics and machine learning to create a predictive model that can alleviate some of the guess work and risk from the venture funding process by executing the following:

1. Prepare and process data for an neural network model.

2. Us the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

3. Optimize the model.

## TECHNOLOGIES

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Enables the user to use the powerful Python programming language.

[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) - Access to the web-based IDE JupyterLab.  

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Grants access to the open-source Pandas data analysis tool, which is powered by Python.

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) - An end-to-end open source machine learning platform that provides an ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources.

[Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) - Provides users with a library of tools for predictive data analysis.

[Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) - Enables the user to read compiled historical lending data.

## USAGE

In order to execute this Deep Learning neural network model, you must run the following:

```
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler,OneHotEncoder
```

Accessing JupyterLab in Bash: `Jupyter Lab`
